# Express-book-management api project üìö

The first project for the gaza sky geeks express training. The requirements were creating apis that can put,post,delete, and get for a book management scenario.

# AWS Project üêé ü•á
Another project was to build on the previous one and deploy this app to the aws console behind an autoscaling group and with an applicaion load balancer.

I used the script named [setup-instance.sh](https://github.com/Isracoder/express-book-management/blob/main/setup-instance.sh) in this repo to automate the process of installing nodejs , cloning the repo , and setting up the app to be managed by systemd. To make systemd manage it i created the [app.service](https://github.com/Isracoder/express-book-management/blob/main/app.service) file which runs the index.js file. Then I enabled the service file in the setup script. 

This is a screenshot of some of the testing in my terminal.

After I made sure that the script was working by testing it on individual instances it was time to create the load balancer.

I attached it to a target group in which i registered one of the working instances that i created with the final working version of the setup script

Then I created the auto scaling group and linked it to the application load balancer and target group previously created. I also selected all availability zones to distribute the instances.

After creating the autoscaling group more instances were created and added to the target group for a total of 3. At first the two instances created by the asg were unhealthy however I resolved that issue by making sure the script was correct and changing the health settings .

Finally the api was up and running on port 80 and could be accessed by the asg instances.Here is the initial full list that shows when loading the page.
